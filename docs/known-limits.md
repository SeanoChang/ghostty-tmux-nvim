# Known limits

Findings from reviews that were real but minor, so they were logged and not
fixed. Each entry says what happens and why it was accepted.

## `config/claude/hooks/merge-gate.py`

Reviewed on 2026-11-10 at sha1 `9443fb995e1be73846dbd741a4d54f649e0e8375`.

### By design

- **A merge that does not begin the command gets no decision.** This covers
  `cd x && gh pr merge …`, an env prefix, a wrapper such as `timeout`, a path
  such as `/opt/homebrew/bin/gh`, a quoted or escaped spelling, and a leading
  comment line. The normal permission flow handles these. The hook does not
  look for a merge inside a larger command, because that needs a full model
  of bash.
- **The hook is not a security boundary.** `gh api`, `git push` to the
  integration branch, a script, and a forged review comment all go past it.
  The review comment is written by the same account by design.
- **A repo with no CI can never pass.** A check that has not registered yet
  is not visible to the hook.
- **Argument errors are reported before the lookup.** A command with a bad
  flag gets only the flag errors, not the PR conditions as well.
- **A help request must be in plain words.** `gh pr merge --help | cat`, or
  help with a quote, a brace or a glob, is denied.
- **`~`, a glob or a brace in a text flag value is passed literally.** The
  rebuilt command quotes every value, so bash does not expand it.

### Minor, not fixed

- **A payload Python cannot parse gets no decision.** Examples: an integer
  of more than 4,300 digits, or nesting about 100,000 deep. The hook cannot
  read the command, and the normal permission flow applies. Claude Code does
  not send such payloads.
- **More than 1,024 inherited file descriptors make every merge a deny.**
  The reader uses `select`, which cannot take a descriptor above 1,023. It
  fails closed. `selectors.DefaultSelector` would remove the limit.
- **A valid answer close to 16 MB can use about 450 MB of memory.** The byte
  cap bounds the text, but `json.loads` builds objects about 30 times larger
  for an answer made of millions of empty objects. Real `gh` does not print
  that shape.
- **A child that `gh` leaves behind after a successful lookup keeps
  running.** The hook kills the process group only when the lookup fails.
  Real `gh` leaves no such child.
- **The hook's own stdout closed or broken gives a non-zero exit.** The
  harness could not read an answer in that case anyway.

### Tested in a real session (2026-11-10, Claude Code 2.1.319)

Headless `claude -p` runs with a fake `gh` first on PATH, in a folder that is
not a git repo:

- A valid merge written as `--match-head-commit <sha>` ran without a prompt,
  and `gh` received the rebuilt `--match-head-commit=<sha>`. So Claude Code
  applies `updatedInput` together with an allow.
- A merge without the sha, with `--admin`, or with `--delete-branch` was
  refused with the hook's reason, and `gh` was not called.
- `gh pr checks 12` and `cd . && gh pr merge …` got no decision from the hook
  and were stopped by the normal approval.

### Not tested

- A real merge on GitHub. The first one is the remaining check.
- Shell state that Claude Code adds: an alias or function named `gh`, or
  `GH_REPO` / `GH_HOST` set in the shell but not in the hook's environment.
- Whether the payload's `cwd` follows an earlier `cd` in the Bash tool. If it
  does not, a merge with no selector could look up another branch.
- Commands run under zsh. The tokenizer was compared with macOS `/bin/bash`
  3.2 only. The rebuilt command and plain-words help are safe under zsh by
  reasoning, not by test.
- `gh` versions other than 2.103.3, and real GitHub answers for edge cases
  (more than 100 checks, comment paging, stale check runs).

## Review rules (`config/claude/CLAUDE.md`, `config/claude/agents/`)

Reviewed on 2026-11-10 at commit `0a4b43a`. One review read the rules for
gaps, contradictions and loops, and a second one in fresh context checked its
list. Three Important gaps were fixed: a reviewer could run a command that
needs approval, a diff could outgrow its task's tier, and no rule covered a
repo with no `dev` branch or no CI.

### Minor, not fixed

- **"Less adversary" has no rule for a re-check that reports broken.** It
  allows one adversary pass and one re-check. A broken re-check is the second
  failure, and the third round never comes. The merge gate still needs
  ` adversary=held`, so the merge is denied: it fails safe.
- **No rule says a branch must be up to date with `dev` before the squash.**
  Two PRs, each reviewed against an older `dev`, can merge into a combination
  that no reviewer saw. CI on each head commit limits this.
- **The verifier's "uncommitted changes" rule does not name untracked or
  unrelated files.** One verifier leaves the review line out for an untracked
  file that is not part of the change; another keeps it.
- **A fix round can start on a finding that no refuter checked.** The refuter
  rule covers findings that reach Sean, not findings that start a fix. A false
  Important then costs one round and counts toward the limit of three.
  "Release-blocking" is not defined.
- **The Plan page example drifts from the eight-line brief.** In
  `visual-artifacts/references/plan.md` the task's Files row lists one file
  and its copied brief lists two, and the copied Files line has no "must not
  touch" part. `builder.md` ("Touch only the files in your brief") still
  bounds the edit.
